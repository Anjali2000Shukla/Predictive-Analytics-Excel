üçΩÔ∏è Predicting Restaurant Tips ‚Äî Excel Analytics Project
This repository contains an Excel-based data analysis project focused on predicting restaurant tip amounts. The project demonstrates how to apply data cleaning, categorical encoding, pivot tables, correlation, and multiple regression using Excel‚Äôs Data Analysis Toolpak.

üìå Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a restaurant tips dataset and build a regression model in Excel that predicts the tip amount based on factors such as:
* Total Bill
* Gender (Sex)
* Smoker/Non-Smoker
* Day of the Week
* Time of Day (Lunch/Dinner)
* Party Size
Through Excel‚Äôs tools, we perform data cleaning, encode categorical values, visualize insights with pivot tables and charts, calculate correlations, and finally run a multiple regression to derive a prediction equation.



üìñ Learnings & Skills Demonstrated
* Data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel
* Encoding categorical variables with formulas (IF, =--())
* Creating pivot tables and pivot charts (pie/bar)
* Correlation analysis in Excel
* Applying Multiple Linear Regression with the Toolpak
* Comparing predicted vs actual values
* Project documentation and GitHub presentation
